# Flight-Delay-Prediction

As We have seen sometimes that flights has been delayed sometimes because of mis-happening or other various reasons so what if we predict when , how and what are the circumstances which leads to flight delays.

So I have made a model using Machine Learning and Data Science Tools

Data has been collected from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/code/stinky/flight-delay-prediction

We have given some independent parameters and by appying different types of machine learning models we have predicted the accuracy .
